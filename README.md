# Multimodal-offensivness-detectaction
## Description
Memes are an important part of online culture, it usually consists of images or videos
with humor or text that can spread quickly through comments. However, it can present
false information, negative words and questionable content, which can lead to serious
consequences such as depression or anxiety in victims. The challenge of analyzing
abstract content in memes and other digital data has inspired research into natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) and many other tools. These involve using pre-trained mod-
els to analyze text and visual content to better understand offensive content. Despite
progress, challenges remain in interpreting the interconnectedness of patterns in digital
contexts and the patterns of context awareness needed to ethically explain these effects
and ensure freedom of expression when protesting online material. This emphasizes the
necessity of offensive detection, which is why in this suggested method, we extract text
features using the BERT Model and extract images features using Resnet-50. Addition-
ally, we concatenate the features from both sides using Feature Concatenation, which
produce results for the detection of different offensive classes.
